      <p><strong> A common factor amongst the current owners of hot rods is to make them more noticeable. There are now many different sectors of Hot Rodding, some of which are:</strong></p>
      <p><b>Billet Rods </b>(street rods noted by many items being machined from Billet aluminum)</p>
      <p><b>Traditional Rods</b> (those that built according to a particular point in time and stick to those build techniques and materials)</p>
      <p><b>Rat rods</b> (those that are pieced together to look like old time jalopies, although some times they require more work than a show rod)</p>
      <p><b>Show Rods</b> (Hot Rods created to compete in National Car Shows such as AMBR (America's Most Beautiful Roadster), and the Detroit Autorama)</p>
