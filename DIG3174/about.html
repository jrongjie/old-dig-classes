        <p class="aboutGI">If there’s one thing my parents had taught me it is that there’s nothing that brings people together like food and drinks, and nothing that makes people feel better than a cup of hot chocolate. Originally, this business had been just a project that I worked on as part of grad school. I was challenged to create a unique brand and go through all of the steps as if I wanted to make a real business. Then here we are today!</p>
