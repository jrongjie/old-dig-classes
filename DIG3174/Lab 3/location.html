        <h2>How to Find Edzel's</h2>
        <p>We're conveniently located just off I-π.  A short 7 hour drive from Miami, 5 hours from Orlando,
          3 hours from Tallahassee, and 6 hours from Pensacola.  Take exit 347̃ and you'll see a dirt road on the
          right.  Follow that for about a mile, then take the next 19 right turns.  You should see a woman with
          a fruit stand.  Buy 2 blueberries and a single Gala apple.  Once this transaction is complete, the woman
          will take you into the woods.  Follow her for about 30-45 minutes.  It might seem like she's walking
          around in circles, but trust her.  When you emerge from the forest (ideally after having a life changing
          epiphany), you'll be right on our doorstep.  Please don't try to find us with Google Maps.  The insist
          that Falske isn't a real place, and they additionally insist that Edzel's Invisible Oddities is not a real
          thing.  You're on the website, so obviously we're real.</p>
